Paragraph 1
There once was a badger named Bucky. He really liked football and doing push ups.
One time Bucky did 100 push ups in a row! 

But there was another mascot... this one did not like bucky, his name was goldy gopher.
Bucky and Goldy Gopher met each other one day, and as soon as Goldy
realized Bucky's pure strength he begged bucky to let the gophers win in football.
"No," said bucky.
